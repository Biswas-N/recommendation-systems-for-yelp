# Personalized Recommendation System for Yelp Users

## Introduction

This data science project focuses on building recommendation systems for restaurants in Pennsylvania, Florida, and Los Angeles, USA, using collaborative filtering techniques. The project aims to compare the performance of different collaborative filtering methods, including memory-based and model-based techniques. The Yelp dataset, containing information about businesses, reviews, and users, will be used to build the recommendation systems. The primary objective is to help a hypothetical restaurant catalog business enhance its customer experience and increase revenue by leveraging the insights gained from the project. The project's results can be applied to other businesses in the restaurant catalog industry, contributing to the advancement of recommendation systems and improving customer experiences.
